                        Tourists at the Temple of Apollo, Delphi, Greece
                        Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.
                        [1] The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go
                        "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only",
                        as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not
                        more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".
                        [2] Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international
                        tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.
                        Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic
                        slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009,
                        and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[3][4] but slowly
                        recovered until the COVID-19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth. The United Nations
                        World Tourism Organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58% to 78% in 2020,
                        leading to a potential loss of US$0.9–1.2 trillion in international tourism receipts.[5]

                        architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids,

                        The Golden Temple (also known as the Harimandir Sahib
                        (lit. 'House of God', Punjabi pronunciation: [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ])
                        , or the Darbār Sahib, (lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ
                        ] or Suvaran Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar,
                        Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.
                        It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur,
                        and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.
                        The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed
                        by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[6][7] In 1604,
                        Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the
                        Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is the prominent figure in the development
                        of gurudwara who built it in the 16th century.[3][8] The Gurdwara was repeatedly
                        rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed
                        several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies.[3][5][9] Maharaja Ranjit
                        Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809,
                        and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.[10][11][12

                        The Golden Temple (also known as the Harimandir Sahib
                        (lit. 'House of God', Punjabi pronunciation: [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ])
                        , or the Darbār Sahib, (lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ
                        ] or Suvaran Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar,
                        Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.
                        It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur,
                        and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.
                        The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed
                        by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[6][7] In 1604,
                        Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the
                        Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is the prominent figure in the development
                        of gurudwara who built it in the 16th century.

                        The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad,
                        Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of
                        Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3]
                        The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its
                        top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant,
                        it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure,
                        and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad.
                        Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha
                        and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

                        Munnar rises as three mountain streams merge - Mudrapuzha,
                        Nallathanni and Kundala. 1,600 m above sea level, this hill station
                        was once the summer resort of the erstwhile British Government in South India.
                        One of the most sought after honeymoon destinations in Kerala, Munnar is replete
                        with resorts and lodging facilities that fit a wide rage of budgets. Sprawling tea
                        plantations, picturesque towns, winding lanes and holiday facilities make this a popular resort town.
                        Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands here is the Neelakurinji.
                        This flower which bathes the hills in blue once in every twelve years, will bloom next in 2030.
                        Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, which towers over 2,695 m.
